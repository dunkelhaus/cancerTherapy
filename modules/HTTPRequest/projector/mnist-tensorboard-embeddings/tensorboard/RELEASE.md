# Release 1.6.0

NOTICE: TensorBoard 1.6.0+ has moved to the `tensorboard` package name on PyPI:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tensorboard. Only bugfix updates on 1.5.x will be
applied to the old package name (`tensorflow-tensorboard`). To upgrade to
TensorBoard 1.6.0+ we suggest you *first* `pip uninstall tensorflow-tensorboard`
before doing `pip install tensorboard`. See "Known Issues" below if you run into
problems using TensorBoard after upgrading.

The 1.6 minor series tracks TensorFlow 1.6.

## Highlights

- (Beta) New Profile dashboard, which provides a suite of tools for inspecting
  TPU performance.  See for details:
  https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/tree/1.6/tensorboard/plugins/profile
- (Alpha) New Debugger dashboard, which provides a visual interface to `tfdbg`,
  the TensorFlow debugger. See for details:
  https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/tree/1.6/tensorboard/plugins/debugger

## Known issues

- Package `tensorboard` is installed but command and/or module are missing or
  have the wrong version - this may be due to conflicts with other packages that
  provide `tensorboard` scripts or modules. Please uninstall *all* such packages
  including `tensorboard`, `tensorflow-tensorboard` and `tb-nightly` and then
  reinstall `tensorboard`.
- Bazel 0.9.0+ required to build from source - this change was necessary in order
  to add support for building at Bazel 0.10.0 and above. Please update Bazel.


# Release 1.5.1

NOTICE: TensorBoard 1.6.0+ will move to the `tensorboard` package name on PyPI,
instead of using `tensorflow-tensorboard`. Only bugfix updates on 1.5.x will be
applied to the old package name. To upgrade to TensorBoard 1.6.0+ please *first*
`pip uninstall tensorflow-tensorboard` before doing `pip install tensorboard`.

The 1.5 minor series tracks TensorFlow 1.5.
