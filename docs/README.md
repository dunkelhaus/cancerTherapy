## Motivation:  
Machine learning can be used to perform unsupervised learning on the DNA sequences of patient tumors in order to  identify non-linear features of the tumor DNA that help predict treatment.  

## Goal:  
To use deep learning to identify patients whose tumor DNA mutations “look similar to” other tumors for which treatments are effective.  

## Platforms: 
TensorFlow

## Installations:
Installing Tensorflow: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.8/install/
